# Calender-with-notes-using-C

This project will be on the “Calendar”. The application prepared here will be a very simple console application developed using C language. 

It will take date, month and year as input and will display the page containing dates of that particular month of that year and user can add any events for a particular date. 

It is a simple project that will mainly rely on switch cases, if else ladders, loops and other functions
